	<h3>What is Wampum?</h3>
	<p>Wampum is a reccomendation engine for stuff you don't need anymore. If you hate the idea of your old clothes and household items going to waste, then it's the helper for you.</p> 

	<p>More specifically, Wampum is a place where you enter the name of an item, and our engine retrieves a list of possible uses for that item, as well as places you can go to drop it off.
	</p>

	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>We aggregate data from various locations around the web, such as lists of clothing dropoffs, or non-profits that are looking for specific materials. We then break your search item down into a list of its constituent materials, and search for organizations that are currently in need of those raw inputs.</p>

	<p> These form the basis for our top suggestions. If you're interested in the gritty details, check out the evolution of our reccomendation engine by following the blog posts.</p>

	<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
	<p>If you've read this far, then first of all thank you for checking us out! Wampum is run by rob@wampum.io, send him an email.</p>
