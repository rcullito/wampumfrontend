<h3>What is Wampum?</h3>
<p>Wampum is a reccomendation engine for stuff you don't need anymore. If you hate the idea of your old clothes and household items going to waste, it might just be the helper for you. More specifically, Wampum is a place where you enter the name of an item, and our engine retrieves a list of possible uses for that item, as well as places you can go to drop it off.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>We basically aggregate data from a lot of different locations around the web, such as a lists of clothing dropoffs, or non-profits that are looking for specific materials. We then have a model which analyzes the materials commonly found in your item, and searches for people and organizations that are currently in need of those materials. These form the basis for our top suggestions. If you're interested in the gritty details, check out the evolution of our reccomendation engine by following the blog posts.</p>

<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
