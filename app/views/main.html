        <p>"After ripping the cuffs of my khakis while commuting to work on my bike, I knew I could no longer wear them for work, but still didn't want to see the materials go to waste. By using Wampum, I was able to get a $10 gift card to J. Crew and some peace of mind knowing that the khakis could be restored by one of the vendors that Wampum sends their clothes to."</p>
