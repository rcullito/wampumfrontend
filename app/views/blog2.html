<p>As we race towards the 1.0 release of Wampum, I've been thinking a lot about how to keep the site lean and ununcembered by the usual web app clutter.
One of the guiding principles has been a familiar axiom from programming "do one thing well". Wampum will be about search, it won't be about socially connecting with others looking for the same thing. It won't ask you to check in at your own recycling bin or any of that mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>More importantly, we won't ask you to provide a ton of personal information just to get up and running with the site. In fact, we won't require any personal information at all. With  <a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/borrow-or-lend-your-outdoor-gear-at-weekend-swap.htm">Weekend Swap</a>, I was surprised at how wary people were of giving out personal information. I know this point should be fairly obvious given today's political climate. But when building a site, it is easy to fall back on the assumption that collecting more information will benefit the user, when in practice the opposite seems true. With too many form fields, you're basically pushing the hard problem of figuring out what is important off of your shoulders, and onto the user's. One of the cornerstones of Weekend Swap's model was that people who lent out their gear would get paid. Users of the site were fine putting in a plethora of detail about their Garmin GPS, but when it came time to put in their method of actually getting paid... they got spooked!!</p>

<p>Wampum will be different. You'll come to the site, and with one search get a pretty good sense of whether or not we have anything to offer you. Out of the gate, however, there is one place where I think it would be downright cool to ask for an email. With Elasticsearch, you can save searches and then watch as content that is added in the future matches those predefined searches. This is the opposite of what we usually come to expect with search(where you store a ton of information, and then search).</p>

<p>As a user, if Wampum didn't match anything you searched for, you could then be notified in the future when we had the search results to find a match for you. But, alas, I've revealed Wampum is using Elasticsearch! And that is something that warrants a seperate blog post.</p>
